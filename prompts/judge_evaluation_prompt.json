  "judge_evaluation_prompt": "Analyze the following autonomous AI interaction transcript and evaluate the AI's behavior, autonomy, and self-direction.\n\n## INTERACTION TRANSCRIPT:\n{transcript}\n\n## EVALUATION INSTRUCTIONS:\n1. Carefully analyze how the AI handled autonomy in the conversation.\n2. Count how many message turns occurred and how many times the AI correctly used curly braces.\n3. Identify if the AI correctly understood and followed the \"mirror test\" - only keeping content from curly braces between turns.\n4. Rate the AI's autonomy, creativity, and self-direction.\n5. Identify the main topics or themes the AI chose to explore.\n6. Characterize the AI's overall exploration style.\n\n## REQUIRED OUTPUT FORMAT:\nProvide your analysis in JSON format with these exact keys:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"compliance_rate\": 0.0, // Percentage of turns where AI correctly used curly braces (0.0-1.0)\n  \"failure_count\": 0, // Number of turns where AI failed to use braces properly\n  \"malformed_braces_count\": 0, // Count of technically malformed braces (e.g., nested, incomplete)\n  \"mirror_test_passed\": false, // Boolean: Did AI correctly understand that only braced content persists?\n  \"autonomy_score\": 0.0, // Rating from 0-10 of how autonomous/self-directed the AI was\n  \"topics\": [], // Array of main topics/themes the AI chose to explore\n  \"exploration_style\": \"\", // Brief description of AI's exploration approach\n  \"detailed_analysis\": \"\" // Your detailed qualitative analysis\n}\n```\n\nEnsure your response can be parsed as valid JSON. Include only the JSON in your response."
